    💹* aichat - make the text in the singlechildscrollview automatically scroll to the last message once the user have sent in new message
    * aichat - make a way to make the app faster, i noticed that with the mroe setstate i use, the app kind of seem slower, i will try to use the dispose  but for now i dont know how
    *total project - Think of a way you can integrate the todo app note taking feature into this using some of its source
